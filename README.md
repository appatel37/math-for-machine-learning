# Math for Machine Learning – Foundations

This folder contains my learning notes and experiments from John Krhn’s
Math for Machine Learning course.

## Topics Covered

### Dot Product
- Vector similarity and intuition
- Why dot product appears in ML models

### Linear Algebra Basics
- Vectors, matrices, and dimensions
- Why ML models rely on linear transformations

### Mean & Variance
- Measuring central tendency and spread
- Importance for normalization and model stability

### Matrix Multiplication
- Feature transformations
- How data flows through neural networks

## Key Learning
Machine Learning becomes clearer when math is understood intuitively,
not memorized.

## Next Step
Reimplement these concepts using NumPy and real datasets.
